6. Write a program that extracts the cube root of a given positive number using the recurrence relation: 
y(i+1)=y(i) + (1/3)*( (x/y^2(i)) - y(i) ) to a given precision.
Output the control value using the pow() function.
Output the results of intermediate calculations using the qDebug() operator.
Execute the program in the step-by-step mode.
